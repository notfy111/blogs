    <description><![CDATA[Question statement How do you tell whether or not, a triangle drawn in a Cartesian plane contains the origin (0,0)?
It is not a brain teaser as far as we can actually draw the trangle using the coordinates for its three corners, and tell from our eye whether or not it is true.
But things get a little bit hard when we need to think about this algorithmically.
How to approach it?]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Question statement This question comes from Euler.com, withe question ID 7.
The original question is straightforward - how do we find the 1001st prime number among all integers?
How to approach this? First, we need to understand what the criterion for a number to be regarded as a prime number : a prime number is an integer that cannot be divded without remainder by any number except for 1 and itself.]]></description>
